Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## What i'm doing here

I'm delighted to introduce a project I'm embarking on â€“ a single-page e-commerce application. This modern web application leverages the power and flexibility of Next.js, a popular React-based framework that provides out-of-the-box features like server-side rendering and static site generation.

Our application will be styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable designs without leaving your HTML. With its "utility-first" approach, we will be able to rapidly build our interface with a wide array of tiny, responsive classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in our markup.

On the backend, we will be using ASP.NET 6 Web API for managing our data. ASP.NET 6 is a modern, open-source framework developed by Microsoft for building high-performance, cross-platform web applications. With its Web API functionality, we will be able to create a robust and scalable backend that handles operations such as managing product inventory, processing orders, user authentication, and more.

By choosing Next.js for our frontend, we'll benefit from its ability to optimize our site for performance, SEO, and accessibility. Tailwind CSS will provide us with the flexibility to create a customized, responsive, and sleek user interface, while ASP.NET 6 Web API will assure a robust and reliable backend.

This e-commerce application is going to showcase the best practices in modern web development while providing an efficient and enjoyable shopping experience for its users. I'm thrilled to bring this project to life and will ensure to keep you updated with its progress.
